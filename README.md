# Fylo dark theme landing page

![Responsive mockup](design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview

This is my solution to the [fylo dark theme landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-dark-theme-landing-page-5ca5f2d21e82137ec91a50fd). Frontend Mentor is a platform where developers can learn and improve their frontend development skills alongside other developers by implementing solutions to challenges. Each challenge includes designs (both mobile and desktop), assets, and a style guide to get you started. The rest is up to you!

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if the input field is empty & the email address is not formatted correctly.

I don't have access to the premium Figma/Sketch files, so the design is not pixel perfect.
